const mockBackstory = "**Birth and Early Life:**\n\nCaelan was born in the bustling port city of Daggerfall to a Breton merchant family. From a tender age, he exhibited an uncanny affinity for the arcane arts, much to the surprise of his parents.\n\n**Awakening to Magic:**\n\nAs Caelan grew, his talent for magic became increasingly evident. He secretly sought guidance from a reclusive mage who resided in the mountains outside the city. Under his tutelage, Caelan honed his skills, mastering both destructive and restorative spells.\n\n**A Life in the Shadows:**\n\nDespite his powerful magical abilities, Caelan kept his life as a mage a closely guarded secret. He feared societal judgment and the potential risks associated with open defiance of the law. Instead, he worked as a merchant's scribe, using his arcane skills to discreetly enhance his trade and protect his family.\n\n**Betrayal and Wanderlust:**\n\nYears later, Caelan's duplicity was discovered by his estranged cousin, who exposed his secret to the authorities. Forced to flee Daggerfall, he embarked on a solitary journey across Skyrim.\n\n**A Path to Chaotic Neutrality:**\n\nAs he traveled, Caelan witnessed the oppressive rule of the Thalmor and the escalating tensions between the Empire and the Stormcloaks. His experiences forged a deep mistrust in all forms of authority, leading him to adopt a chaotic neutral alignment. While he believed in individual freedom and the right to self-determination, he also recognized the dangers of unchecked power.\n\n**Imprisonment:**\n\nDuring his wanderings, Caelan was caught in the crossfire between the Empire and the Stormcloaks. He was erroneously identified as a member of the latter faction and was taken prisoner in the ambush at Helgen.\n\n**Loyalty Undecided:**\n\nDespite his capture, Caelan remains unaligned with either side. He sympathizes with Ulfric's desire for Skyrim's independence but questions the morality of his methods. He also distrusts the Empire's oppressive rule but recognizes the importance of maintaining order. Caelan's ultimate allegiance will be shaped by the events he experiences during his time in Skyrim.\n\n**Family:**\n\nCaelan's parents and younger sister still reside in Daggerfall. His parents are unaware of his life as a mage, while his sister suspects but keeps his secret. Caelan longs for a reunion with them but knows that it would endanger their safety."
